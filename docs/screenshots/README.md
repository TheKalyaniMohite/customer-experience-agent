1. **Use a clean browser window** (hide bookmarks bar)
2. **Set viewport to ~1920x1080** for consistent sizing
3. **Use dark mode** for modern aesthetic (or light if preferred)
4. **Ensure no sensitive data** is visible
5. **Crop to focus** on the relevant UI elements

## File Format

- PNG format recommended
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB each)
- Consider using tools like ShareX or Snagit for clean captures
